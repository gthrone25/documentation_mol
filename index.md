title: FeatureBase Documentation
---

Welcome to FeatureBase! Here you will find various materials to help you use and operate FeatureBase. To navigate through the documentation you can use the navigation toolbar to the left of this section, or you can use the search bar in the upper right hand corner.

We've bought into the notion that there are 4 different types of documentation which each serve a different purpose as detailed [here](https://documentation.divio.com/). As such, our documentation is broken into these four categories:

1. Tutorials — Hands-on introductions for the developer implementing and operating Molecula.
2. Explanations — Background information and discussion of higher level topics.
3. How Tos — Step-by-step recipes for various common tasks.
4. Reference Documentation — Exhaustive technical description of APIs, components, and configuration.

For those new to Molecula we recommend the [Installation Guide](/how-tos/install-featurebase), [Getting Started](/tutorials/getting-started) tutorial, and the [Architecture](/explanations/architecture) explanation.
